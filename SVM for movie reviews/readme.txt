we will use SVM and Ridge to determine whether a movie review (Or any other type of review, such as a product review) is positive or
negative.The dataset contains only one feature (Content) that contains the review text along with the target variable (Label) that indicates whether the review is positive or negative. This dataset was originally prepared and used by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee
in their research paper “A Sentimental Education: Sentiment Analysis Using Subjectivity Summarization
Based on Minimum Cuts”. We will use, in this exercise, a refined dataset that was prepared by Vasista
Reddy. The refined dataset is a csv version of the original dataset. It is composed of two files; one file
contains the training data, and the other file contains the test data.
