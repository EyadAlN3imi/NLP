story of a low-budget horror movie being filmed at the closed-down crippen high , a school where a group of serial murders took place five years before . \\nbut what the cast and crew don't know is that a real killer , maybe the same one that was never apprehended , is going into action again . \\non one level , \\\" return to horror high \\\" is a slasher movie , and it is at this level that it works the best on . \\nwatching the film , which was made in 1987 , i couldn't help but take notice that the killer's costume was almost identital to that of the ghostface in , \\\" scream , \\\" and \\\" scream 2 . \\\" \\non another level , the film wants to be a slapstick comedy , and there are many hints of this throughout . \\nunfortunately , most of these jokes fall flat . \\nand the last thing the film wants to be is a \\\" behind-the-scenes \\\" look at an exploitation film being made . \\nthe only problem is that , while much of it is supposed to be from the movie itself being made , no cameras are shown filming it , thus making it far more confusing than it had to be . \\nand to top it all off , the \\\" twist \\\" ending makes very little to no sense whatsoever , and so we are basically left with feeling as if we wasted our time . \\nthere are story developments that are beyond ludicrous , and plot holes you could drive a winnebago through . \\nif you see the film , or have seen it , you'll know what i mean . \\nthe premise of \\\" return to horror high , \\\" is admittedly pretty crafty , and i liked the atmosphere of the school , which is where the whole thing takes place . \\nbut director froehlich , judging from this movie , is an incompetent director , except for being able to film the seldom suspeneful scene . \\nwell , come to think of it , there is only one scene that is actually scary , and it has to do with two actors being locked in a room as the killer tries to break in . \\nbut other than that two-minute distraction , \\\" return to horror high , \\\" is certainly no great shake . \\nnote : look for george clooney in a supporting role as one of the actors on the film . \\nand strangely enough , he is the first character to get the ax . . . literally . \\n\",\n          \"these days , people have rather short attention span and hardly anything can satisfy them for the long run . \\n1970s nostalgia is already wearing off , and now , people are becoming more and more interested in 1980s . \\nfew years in the future , early 1990s are going to be regarded as next golden age of nostalgia . \\nhowever , i doubt that people are going to be very nostalgic about the hollywood products of that period . \\none of the reason would surely be films like national lampoon's loaded weapon 1 , that , in many ways , symbolise the biggest problem of contemporary american film industry - lack of originality and ideas . \\nbeing made as some kind of parody on lethal weapon series , this film pairs two l . a . policemen - jack colt ( emilio estevez ) , burn-out alcoholic cop on the edge , and wes luger ( samuel l . jackson ) , by-the-book policeman , days away from retirement . \\ntwo of them , following the murder of luger's ex- partner , must confront evil general mortars ( william shatner ) , crime lord who is going to flood the market with cocaine stashed in wilderness girl cookies . \\nthe authors of this films ( whose director , gene quintano , worked on such projects like third and fourth sequel of police academy ) lacked any original idea before they undertook the projects , and that reflects in the lack plot , characters , and , even original lines . \\nthe plot , or what goes for the plot in this movie , is nothing more than a series of gags that make laugh of some popular films made in previous few years ( apart from lethal weapon series , this film \\\" borrows \\\" its female lead from basic instinct ) . \\nthe best gags , are , same as with many other similar movies , shown in the trailers . \\nthe rest simply doesn't work . \\nonly those who used to watch a lot of hollywood products in that period would laugh . \\nothers would probably wince at the lameness of humour . \\nsome would be entertained by celebrity cameos that pop up every once in a while . \\nbut , at the end , spending hour and half in front of this disorganised mess of a movie is simply not worth the effort . \\nthe film was sometimes criticised for being the parody of a series that already had strong comic overtones . \\nthe authors of lethal weapon returned the favour by using the loaded weapon 1 joke in their fourth sequel . \\n\",\n          \"i'm not quite sure what to say about mars attacks ! , which is obviously the work of a deranged genius . \\nwhen tim burton's twisted alien invasion comedy really works , it's breathtaking and hilarious in equal measure . \\nand when it doesn't work , it's just dull . \\ni'm not even sure it works more often than it doesn't , but where it counts -- that is , when this gleefully evil invading force from the red planet gets down to the business of blasting us to kingdom come -- mars attacks ! \\nis brilliant . \\nmars attacks ! \\nis based on a rather unsavory series of trading cards released by topps in the 1950s , and it takes its cues from the same sources as this summer's independence day -- old alien invasion flicks , disaster movies , and big-budget special effects extravaganzas . \\nbut unlike independence day , which was a painfully middle-of-the-road appeal to the hearts , minds and wallets of america , mars attacks ! \\nhas a fully developed and very personal sense of wonder about it . \\nthe big difference is that while independence day celebrated the resilience of human beings , mars attacks ! \\nportrays us as the greedy and hapless schmucks that we are . \\nthe title sequence is just splendid -- an incredible swarm of flying saucers rises out of the canals of the red planet and then storms earthward through the solar system in formation . \\nthe spinning metal saucers are dead ringers for the invading forces of movies past , and their first appearance on the big screen in combination with danny elfman's thundering , theremin-driven score is absolutely jaw-dropping . \\nit's so overwhelming that , i swear to you , i had trouble breathing . \\nthe movie lays low for the next 40 minutes . \\nwe get a glimpse of the alien leader , resplendent in a purple-sequined cape , when a television message is broadcast to the people of the world -- naturally , the only way to communicate with earthlings is to preempt our regularly scheduled programming . \\nbut mostly , the first act is spent developing characters , setting up mildly comic situations , and drawing a quirky but dishearteningly drab picture of america according to tim burton . \\nit's a good thing that the most compelling personality in the movie belongs to the aliens , because burton's just not interested in making more than caricatures out of his human stars . \\nanyone who comes to mars attacks ! \\nexpecting to see a lot of one favorite actor is bound to be disappointed -- with few exceptions , these characters are dispatched as the film progresses . \\njack nicholson is a lot of fun as the president of the united states but fizzles as a sleazy las vegas hotel developer . rod steiger does an amusing enough take on dr . strangelove's buck turgidson , glenn close brings some star power to the role of the first lady , and martin short is a presidential aide who meets the martians in the white house's \\\" kennedy room , \\\" a secluded nook where he unwittingly tries to seduce an alien dressed up as a big-haired , pointy-breasted sexpot ( lisa marie , the burton flame who played vampira in ed wood ) -- in an earlier scene , it's made clear that the aliens studied human sexuality in the pages of an old issue of playboy . \\nsarah jessica parker hosts her own tv show and michael j . fox is her newsman husband . \\nthe octogenarian sylvia sidney has a funny part as the old woman who cackles , \\\" they blew up congress ! \\\" \\nand plays a decisive role in the defeat of the alien menace . \\njim brown and tom jones are the film's vegas-based heroes , and director barbet schroeder ( reversal of fortune ) has a funny cameo as the unfortunate french president . \\nalso on hand and underutilized are annette bening , pierce brosnan , pam grier , lukas haas and natalie portman ( the latter two also show up in woody allen's everyone says i love you ) . \\nthe real stars , of course , are the computer-generated martians , and they're fantastic . \\nwith bare brains glistening atop their grinning skull-faces , round egg-eyes with red pupils darting this way and that , these animated invaders are malevolence incarnate -- joe dante's gremlins are the closest equivalent in recent memory , but burton's little monsters are more inventive . \\nthe film's raison d'etre are the scenes of crimes against mankind -- the most famous monuments of the world crumble under the alien assault , easter island is turned into a bowling alley , and the nasty little buggers perform hideous medical experiments on captured humans . \\nthe sheer level of mayhem is staggering , especially when the aliens make their first attack , blasting human beings into iridescent skeletons . \\nparents are urged to pay special attention to the pg-13 rating -- it's earned . \\nthe special effects vary from charming to astonishing to deliciously cheesy , and at least a couple of shots of mass destruction seem to have been engineered specifically in response to independence day , although mars attacks ! \\nwas in production long before that film's release . \\ncinematographer peter suschitzky , who makes the most of wynn thomas's wildly imaginative production design ( thomas helped define the spike lee style ) , actually took time off from his mars attacks ! \\nregimen to shoot crash for david cronenberg . \\ncronenberg's movie will almost certainly be more somber -- it won't be released in the u . s . until early next year -- but mars attacks ! \\nis surely a similarly elegant nightmare . \\nthis is not a nice movie . \\n ( and which studio executive was duped into giving burton $70 million to make it ? ) \\nby setting the film's final scenes in the nearly empty , holocaust-ravaged america that independence day conveniently avoided , burton's invasion epic suggests that the world we've got may not be worth saving until many of the people on it are dead . \\nthe victims of his invasion are naive , greedy , or disastrously self-absorbed -- and a good thing , too , since the movie's wicked charm is dependent on our ability to take this invasion partly as a wish-fulfillment fantasy . \\nthe surviving cast members are the innocents and the entertainers , who triumph by determining that the alien invaders -- the ultimate elitists -- are actually susceptible to the kitschiest strains of american pop culture . \\nultimately , this messy masterpiece is the year's funniest comedy and a weird , winking affirmation of the power of the people . \\n\"\n        ],\n

legendary status which prevents the reviewer to say anything original . \\none of such masterpieces is casablanca , probably not the best film in the history of the seventh art , but definitely the most popular one . \\nits popularity can be measured not in a multitude of more or less disguised remakes that were made in more than half a century since its premiere , but also in countless tributes and references that movie makers use in their works to this day . \\ncasablanca is also a movie that has the very rare virtue of both being praised by the critics and loved by general audience . \\none of the things that makes this film even more unique was the fact that it was doomed to fail , at least judging by conventional movie-making wisdom of its time . \\nit was based on a broadway play so mediocre that it hadn't been produced on stage ; screenplay by three writers - julius g . epstein , philip j . epstein and howard koch - was beeing written as shooting went along ; the main actors were producers' second choice , and , finally , man behind camera , michael curtiz was considered to be capable , but not great director . \\nhowever , the movie was commercially successful and earned three \\\" oscars \\\" , including the one for the best film . \\nuntil this very day , it is considered to be the best example of hollywood film- making in its own golden age . \\nthe plot of the movie was heavily influenced by the needs of ww2 propaganda , yet it also used rather complicated and now almost forgotten political circumstances of that global conflict in order to make intriguing story . \\nin december 1941 , casablanca , exotic port on the atlantic coast of north africa is controlled by officially neutral , yet nazi-collaborating french vichy government . \\nthousands of refugees from war-torn europe are stuck there on the way to lisbon and safety of america , and ready to pay any price for precious exit visas . \\nmany shady characters thrive on their misery , including the corrupt police chief , captain renault ( rains ) . \\nhis best friend is rick blaine ( bogart ) , who used to be idealistic anti-fascist , and now owns popular night club in casablanca and lives by his own cynical philosophy of \\\" sticking his neck for nobody \\\" . \\nhowever , everything changes when he gets in possession of two precious extra visas . \\nthis event coincides with the arrival of two new refugees to casablanca . \\none of them is victor laszlo ( henreid ) , czech resistance leader who escaped three times from nazi concentration camps and became the legend of enslaved europe . \\nhe is accompanied by his beautiful wife ilsa lund ( bergman ) , with whom rick had a stormy affair in the eve of nazi occupation of paris . \\nthe couple needs visas , especially because of the gestapo major strasser ( veidt ) being on their trail . \\nrick is now forced to choose between love , wounded pride , self-preserving interest and his own hatred of fascism . \\nthe casting for this movie seems influenced by divine inspiration - humphrey bogart , most legendary actor in the history of cinema , is one of the rare character actors who elevated his persona to the star status . \\nbogart's portrayal of rick as complicated man , torn between idealistic past and bitter present , was so perfect , that his icon would forever be connected with that character . \\nanother icon in his company is ingrid bergman , great actress of old hollywood , here in her artistic and visual prime . \\nthe cinematic coupling of bogart and bergman became one of the main symbols of that era of filmmaking - some happier times when the romance on the screen didn't look childish nor trite like in some more contemporary works . \\nfor many people , casablanca is probably the best romantic film ever made . \\nbut the reason for that isn't the romance itself - it's the realistic story of people forced to make tough , and often wrong choices in their life . \\nthe casting of casablanca was right on target not just in a case of main leads . \\nthe supporting actors also did a marvellous job . \\nsidney longstreet and peter lorre were here mainly to give a mystic flavour spotted in a previous bogart classic - john huston's maltese falcon ; yet both of them managed to portray colourful and original characters . \\nanother shining example of good casting is now almost forgotten paul henreid as the weakest part of love triangle ; character of victor laszlo has believable charisma and looks like a somebody who could inspire millions of people to rise against nazi tiranny . \\nunfortunately , the charisma that burdened laszlo , leaves little place for difficult choice , making his character forever overshadowed by rick/ilsa coupling . \\nhowever , rick and ilsa actually have a serious competiton for most memorable character in casablanca . \\ncaptain renault , brilliantly portrayed by claude rains in a role of a lifetime , was embodiment of perfect , almost unmatched balance between ethical corruption and physical charm . \\ndespite being the undoubtful villain in almost entire movie , rains managed to make renault sympathetic character , and his final conversion to the side of good , symbolized in not so subtle gesture at the end of movie looked unnecessary . \\nrains also gave another dimension to the movie , making it even more ambiguous ; people who like to analyse movies to death discovered signs of homosexuality in renault's relationship towards rick , and rick's final words leave room for even more outrageous speculations . \\ntogether with well-drawn characters and exciting story , the movie was good in creating his own atmosphere . \\nprofessional nitpickers would probably have a field day in discovering numerous historical and geographical inaccuracies , but casablanca is still a shining example of hollywood ww2 movie that is beliavable , if not realistic . \\nany way , even if we don't see it as a historical document , casablanca is movie that can be source of entertainment as well as infinite inspiration . \\n\",\n          \"gere , willis , poitier chase each other around the world \\nthe jackal a film review by michael redman copyright 1997 by michael redman \\nwhen the soviet union imploded , the western countries lost their shadow . \\nwith the united states friendly with the russians , we no longer had an entity to blame for the world's problems . \\nthis showed up in hollywood films as the communist government was no longer the easy bad guy . \\nit's time to rejoice because we've found our new villain . \\nnow it's no longer the russian government who sends killers out into foreign lands , it's the russian _mafia_ . \\na perfect solution , it combines the dread of organized crime and the still-present uneasiness with the former eastern block countries . \\nbest of all , the villains are still foreigners : fear of the other always plays best . \\nso it is a crime lord in moscow that sends legendary hitman the jackal ( bruce willis ) to assassinate a highly placed us government figure in retaliation for the death of his brother during a nightclub raid . \\nthe fbi is at a loss as to how to protect the target from someone they're not sure even exists . \\ncoming to their rescue is former ira operative declan mulqueen ( richard gere ) who is temporarily released from prison to assist fbi agent carter preston ( sidney poitier ) and russian major valentina koslova ( diane venora ) . \\nmulqueen's ex-girlfriend basque terrorist isabella ( mathilda may ) is the only person who has seen the elusive jackal . \\n ( presumably there is an exclusive international terrorist club somewhere where the three met . ) \\nthe film follows two parallel tracks as the jackal prepares for his $70 million hit and mulqueen attempts to locate him while preston makes sure that the irishman doesn't slip away . \\ncrossing numerous borders and donning various disguises for both himself and his mini-van , the killer is always one step ahead of his pursuers . \\nbeing very loosely based on the same book the 1973 thriller \\\" the day of the jackal \\\" , comparison between the two films is inevitable . \\nthere is no doubt that the original is the better movie , playing the story for suspense rather than the current action/adventure . \\nas a mystery , \\\" the jackal \\\" has enough holes in it to ruin the tale , but if you can accept it for what it is , there's entertainment to be had . \\nholes ? let's see ? a pivotal clue for mulqueen is so obscure that he must possess psychic powers to pick it up . \\nfor a 20-year veteran that can command the big bucks , the jackal is an incredibly poor shot . \\nthe final scene between gere and willis occurs in a location that should be mobbed with police , but it's just the two of them . \\nwillis' disguises usually look like bruce willis and are just as interesting as val kilmer's in \\\" the saint \\\" . \\n ( and lest you misunderstand , that's not a compliment . ) \\nbut the three stars are fun to watch . \\nit's good to see gere in something other than a business suit . \\nwillis has a mixed history in picking projects , but his characters are always watchable . \\npoitier is by far the superior actor , but has limited screen time . \\nthe problems in logic are flaws , but don't ruin the experience . \\noccasionally there are movies that transcend their blemishes . \\nthis is one of them . \\n[the appeared in the 11/20/97 \\\" bloomington voice \\\" , bloomington , indiana] \\n\",\n          \"the premise is simple , if not bizarre . \\na mad scientist ( trace beaulieu as dr . clayton forrester ) launches an average-joe ( michael j . nelson as mike nelson ) into space where he forces his subject to watch the most horrendous movies ever made . \\nwhy ? \\nit's torturous , it's maniacal , and it's just plain fun . \\nbased on the cult-favorite cable television series , mystery science theater 3000 : the movie isn't torturous , but as for being maniacal and just plain fun , it foots the bill quite nicely . \\nmike nelson , on a dog-bone shaped spacecraft , spends his days as any young man would dream - indulging in sarcasm and horseplay , and seeing quite a few movies . \\nthe catch is , these movies aren't the movies he chooses , but retched examples of film-making chosen specifically by dr . forrester in an attempt to break mike's will to live . \\ndr . forrester is convinced that one too many b- movies is all it will take to ruin a man , but with a couple of wise-cracking puppet buddies ( tom servo , voiced by kevin murphy , and crow t . robot , voiced by beaulieu ) , the torture becomes somewhat of a honorary party for all that is wrong in the world of cheezy cinema . \\nthe purpose behind mst3k is to exploit some of the worst films known ( even if by very few of us ) to man . \\nwe watch as the silhouettes of mike , tom , and crow sit in a darkened theater poking fun at the movie going on before them . \\nin this case , it's the 1954 sci-fi film this island earth . \\nwe basically watch as our three leads watch , only we get the pleasure of eavesdropping on their hilarious commentary . \\nthe plots behind the movies ripped apart are really quite irrelevant , but for the sake of those who might want to know , i'll explain this one . \\nthis island earth is the tale of two scientists , a man and a woman , who wind up aboard a spaceship whose crew intends to destroy the earth . \\ntogether the two fight to survive as well as save their home planet . \\nto make mst3k work , the film-within-the-film naturally has to be as horrible as possible , and although the tv-series introduced us to several worse films than this island earth , it's a bad enough flick to bring about some hysterical cruelty . \\nmst3k , which doesn't actually contain the complete this island earth , is a short 73 minutes , but this is a step very wisely taken . \\nas funny as some of their observations are , it can only go so long . \\noccasional breaks from this island earth also help the film tremendously . \\nalthough it takes a second to get back into the right mode after this premise has been left for a moment , it's better than overkilling the whole concept post haste . \\nmst3k lovers will likely hail the film greatly , but if you don't know what you're in for , it could be a jarring disappointment . \\nalthough i thought the sharp wit of this film was worth three stars , it is a movie to be seen on home video , late at night when your brain is not functioning to full capacity anyway , and with a large , saracastic crowd - new year's at midnight for example , which is when i saw it . \\nwarning : although mst3k has more to its end credits than most ( the three leads use the credits to poke some more fun ) , they are actually more annoying than most . \\nthe name slandering and asinine one-liners were extremely unfunny , and after laughing for about 70 minutes straight , it put a heavy damper on the overall experience . \\nmost people will likely stay to see what the smart-alec's have to say , but for me , it almost ruined an otherwise good film . \\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\":
